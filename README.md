    Step 3->
    Home/Discussions Page (Html and CSS, no JS)

Notes Landing Page Style

    1)  color: inherit -> it specifies that the color should be inherited from the parent.
    2)  background: no-repeat center/cover -> is saying place a background image in the element, but only show one instance of it (no-repeat) the   image in the vertical centre, and horizontal centre of the element. This is related to the background-position property. By using the be cover value you are saying scale the background image to be as large as possible so that the background area is completely covered by the background image.
    3)  transform: sacle(o.98) -> defines a transformation that resizes an element on the 2D plane. It can take two(x and y) or one(same x and y) parameters in vector form.
    4)  transition: background 0.5s ease-in-out -> transition allows elements to change values over a specified duration, animating the property changes, rather than having them occur immediately. Background specifies that only the backround has to be changed. Apart from background we can have "all" or "padding" etc.
    5)  background-attachment:fixed  -> sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed.
    6)  z-index: 10  -> The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element. An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.
