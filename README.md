Phases of the Project

Phase 1

    Step 1-> 
    Landing Page (HTML and CSS encoded), all relevant assests found
    To be added: footer with contact us details. Our vision maybe. Better background
    

    Step 2-> 
    Signup/Login Page (HTML and CSS, no JS)

    Step 3->
    Home/Discussions Page (Html and CSS, no JS)
    
 Currently looking into the possibility of implementing text-animation as the background for the landing-page. 
 
 # Will use ONLY CSS for this.
 
    The idea is to have multiple copies of the word "NSUT" be animated in the background, NOT user responsive, just animated. Either or -
    We create a GIF with mulitple copies of the word "NSUT" floating in the background and simply put that into our project. 
 
 Currently exploring the first possibility
